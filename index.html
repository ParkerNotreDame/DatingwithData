                     America’s population regulation problem is a complex issue involving culture, regulation, medicine, immigration, religion, and more. It cannot be corrected with one simple action, but it must be corrected.

                     Immigration cannot sustain America permanently. Ultimately, the fix must come mostly from within, and that change starts with you. If you’re an American willing to have kids but haven’t yet, let the data guide you.

                     Civilizational collapse is only an issue if we let it become one. With collective and top-down action, there’s a road to a bright American future. It is said that “it takes a village to raise a child,” but it will take our children to maintain the village.

         <h2>Learning from Speed Dating</h2>
         <p>The main data referenced in this project is speed dating data produced in a study by the University of Columbia. It reveals a lot in the way of preferences, self-perception, perception of others, and who gets the most attention. If you're struggling with dating for a mate and you're open to self-improvement based on hard data, we suggest you read on.</p>

         <h2>Our Inspiration</h2>
         <p>We have been surprised by the childlessness epidemic in America and the West. In the age of indulgence, it seems that many prefer living a childless life to focus on personal pursuits. On a mathematical level, everyone needs to have one child (one per parent), in order to sustain the population. Otherwise, others must overperform the underperformers to keep the population to at least keep the population stable. That has formerly worked since the beginning of time, but it is true no longer. American childless adults have outweighed parents. Not everyone is suited to have children. That has always been true and if you're not called to have children, that's not an issue. The real issues, though, are many. Large scale institutions have begun directly and indirectly discouraging child rearing, but you can end it with one date. We've prepared this website to personally arm you with this skills you need to find your lifetime best friend, lover, and mate. Let's get you ready to date.
