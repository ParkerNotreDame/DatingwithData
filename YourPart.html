         <h1>Your Part</h1>
         <p>The American birth rate is 1.66 live births per woman. A population needs at least 2 children per woman to sustain its size. The current population halving time is 3.75 generations. In other words, America will be half its current size by the time your children perish, if you have any. But you can end it with one date. So arm yourself with data, strap in, and get to dating and procreating.</p>

         <p>Learn from the best daters in our population. The top 25% in terms of call backs had these trait profiles on average. It may please you to know that the most successful daters had a well-rounded profile. Results were nearly the same between men and women. The traits sincerity, intelligence and fun actually beat out ambitiousness and looks. In other words, it's not the money or the looks, but the personality and thoughtfulness that won.</p>

         <p>It was the daters who seemed to care just the right amount that performed the best. We suspect that those who wanted a relationship to come out of speed dating might have come off as overbearing, while the ones who just wanted to "say I did it" didn't try hard enough. Those looking just to meet and to have some fun were the most productive.</p>

         <p>Dating isn't just all about the main traits like looks or funness. If you want a life partner, you'd also want someone who matches or complements your interests. You can use the chart below to see which kind of people, in terms of interest areas, you might be interested in based on your own interests. If you're into theater, you might find that a lot of theater buffs also like museums, but they probably don't like sports. Now you know who to look for.</p>

         <p>There's nothing to fear but fear itself. Rejection isn't a big deal and you shouldn't let it get in the way of taking a chance. Here are how many successful dates men or women had during speed dating, as measured by how many callbacks they got. Most often it was zero! That's okay and it means you can only do better, not worse.</p>

         <p>We want to highlight the impact of income to say that finding and attracting a compatible partner isn't just for someone else. It can be for you too. As discussed, you don't need to be a runway model or a conversational genius.  You don't need to be rich either. You need to be well-rounded and have memorable character traits.</p>
