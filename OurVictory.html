         <h1>Our Victory</h1>
         <p>Even with continued legal immigration, there will likely be a dip in the total American population as today's baby boomer's grow old. There will certainly be a decline in the working age population. The sooner we can recover the American birth rate, the less the gap will be. Below, we propose a timeline where the issues we have discussed get addressed, and most importantly you take action. If the birth rate recovers from 1.66 to 2.00 by 2030, you can see our calculation for population recovery below.</p>

         <p>The above is a family of population overproducers. Potential parents don't need to look anything like this, nor support these many kids. Three is the magic number. Studies show 45% of Americans want to have two kids. Twenty-nine percent say they want to have three. If you join the 29% and follow through, America will stay its course, a successful, safe, and prosperous place for all of our children, grandchildren, and beyond to enjoy, no matter how many you have.</p>

         <h2>Call to Action</h2>
         <p>No amount of legal changes, doctors' decisions, or technological factors can change that the future is in your hands. It is your choice whether our America can continue as the greatest country on earth. To find a good partner, you need to be a good partner. That will take introspection and self-development which is a good thing, even outside dating.</p>
         <p>We hope that you have found our data helpful in structuring your path to finding and securing your Mr. or Ms. Right. We also hope you take this on as your solemn duty, an act of self-improvement that is also a donation to the common good. All of the rights, privileges, and opportunities you experience in America are the result of our shared hard work, the hard work of human people. We can only continue with your help. Good luck out there!</p>
